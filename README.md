# Final-Project_DEZ2025
Hereby I present my Final Project for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025

## Bitcoin Trading Patterns Pipeline
This project analyzes Bitcoin trading patterns from 2018-2024 using Binance data from Kaggle ("BITCOIN Historical Datasets 2018-2025") to help investors understand price volatility and trading activity. It uses Terraform to create a GCP Bucket, Airflow to orchestrate uploading the CSV and transforming it with PySpark, BigQuery as the data warehouse, and Looker Studio for visualization.
